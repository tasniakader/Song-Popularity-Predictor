# Music Popularity Prediction

This project predicts whether a song will be popular based on features like artist, genre, energy, tempo, and more. The model uses Logistic Regression with L2 regularization for binary classification to understand the factors that contribute to a song's popularity.
**Project Report.pdf** describes the findings of the project and **song_popularity_logreg.ipynb** contains the code used to implement the model.
This project was done for the final project of CIS3715: Principles of Data Science in the Spring of 2025 at Temple University.
